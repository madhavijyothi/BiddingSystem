# BiddingSystem
Backend system for this design.
PROBLEM: Design a Bidding System, wherein
• Vendors, who can come and put their products up for bidding for a given slot within a date and time
duration.
• The registered users can visit the page to check the different products (by category), which are up
for bidding. They can choose and bid for a product of their choice.
• Each product has a base price, and the bidding for that product can be done with a price which is
higher or equal to this base price. A bidding for a lesser price should throw an error.
• At the end of the slot duration for a given product, choose the winner and send a communication to
them.
